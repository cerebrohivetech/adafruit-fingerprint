Responses
=========

This is the core response documentation. This and the :ref:`interface`
is all the documentation you need look at to implement a use case like
the ones in :ref:`example_codes`.

The `Confirmation code (A response object)` found as most of the returns
of the methods of the `AdafruitFingerprint` class implemented in the
:ref:`interface`
module are implemeneted here.

`H` here simply means the values are hex values. E.g ``00H`` means
``0x00``.
